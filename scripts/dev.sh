cannot reach the local database named in dev.env. If PostgreSQL is running,
it probably has no role or database for this site yet:

    createuser --pwprompt ${user}
    createdb --owner ${user} ${name}

Then run this script again. podpack does not create either: the server is
yours, and a run script that issued DDL against it would be doing something
you did not ask for.
