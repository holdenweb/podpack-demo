# Two stages, because three things are needed to *build* the venv and none of
# them to run it: git, uv, and uv's download cache. Together they are half the
# image -- 398MB single-stage against 203MB here -- so the runtime stage takes
# the finished venv and leaves the toolchain behind.

# layer on top. Not shipping it at all is what the second stage is for.
